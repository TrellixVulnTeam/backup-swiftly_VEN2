CONFIG SETUP:

    1. Configure hpcloud account credentials in ./tests/config.json

    2. Configure remote host info (for use with remote test)

    3. Add the remote execution host identify file to the host executing the script
       ssh-add remotehost_identity_key

TESTS:

    1 . test_backup_swiftly.py

        This test will run locally on a linux machine and:

        Tar up test files
        Encrypt test files
        Upload to swift
        Download from swift
        Decrypt
        Unpack
        Compare what was pushed to swift and what was pulled from swift, to make sure they are identical.

    2. test_ssh_remote_backup_swiftly.py

        This wraps the test above, yet it does it on a remote machine over ssh.


HOW TO RUN:

    python test_backup_swiftly.py

    python test_ssh_remote_backup_swiftly.py
